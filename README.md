# Helm Chart Guide for a Spring Boot Application

## What is a Helm Chart?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, similar to how Homebrew is used on macOS, Chocolatey on Windows, or APT on Ubuntu. It facilitates the process of managing Kubernetes applications by allowing users to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications succinctly using a Helm Chart.

A Helm Chart is a collection of files organized in a specific directory structure, which describes a related set of Kubernetes resources. Charts can simplify the deployment and management of applications and services on a Kubernetes cluster, making it easier to define, version, and manage than manually handling complex `yaml` files.

## Why Use Helm Charts?

### Scenario Explaining the Relevance of Helm Charts

Consider a scenario where you need to deploy Jenkins on different operating systems like macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu. Each platform has its package manager that simplifies software installation. Similarly, for Kubernetes clusters, instead of manually configuring multiple complex YAML files for deployment, services, and management, you use a Helm chart. The Helm chart abstracts these details into a simple set of configurations that can be managed more intuitively.

### Challenges Addressed by Helm

Deploying applications on a Kubernetes cluster without Helm can present several challenges:

#### 1. Defining, Managing, and Executing Multiple Manifest Files
Without Helm, you have to manually handle multiple manifest files for different resources like deployments, services, and persistent volumes. Itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient.

#### 2. Deployment Ordering Challenge
The correct order of deployment is critical. For instance, a database must be ready before the app that uses it starts. Helm manages these dependencies effectively, ensuring resources are deployed in the correct sequence.

#### 3. Versioning and Rollbacks for All Resources
Helm tracks versions of your deployments and allows for easy rollbacks to a previous stable state, which is complex to manage manually with raw Kubernetes yaml files.

#### 4. Environment-Specific Configuration Files
Helm allows you to tweak your configurations to fit different environments (development, staging, production) without changing the core application logic. This separation of concerns simplifies management and enhances security.
